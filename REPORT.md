M-Commerce Project Report: GadgetHut (Neon)

Student Name: JOEL TOM VARGHESE


1. Project Overview

This project is a full-stack M-Commerce (Mobile Commerce) web application named "GadgetHut". It was built using a LAMP stack (PHP, Apache, MySQL) and deployed to a cloud environment (AWS EC2).

The application provides a professional, responsive user interface with a modern cream, white, black, and neon-green color scheme. It allows users to browse products, add items to a dynamic shopping cart, and "checkout," which saves the order to a backend database.

2. Core Components

Frontend: A responsive, mobile-first single-page application built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It features a dark/light mode toggle, dynamic product loading, and a full-featured shopping cart.

Backend: A RESTful API built with PHP. It handles database connections and business logic for fetching products (products.php) and creating orders (create_order.php).

Database: A MySQL database (run via MariaDB on EC2) to store product, user, and order information.

Cloud Deployment: The entire LAMP application is hosted on an AWS EC2 (t2.micro) instance.

Version Control: The source code is managed and versioned using Git and hosted on GitHub.
